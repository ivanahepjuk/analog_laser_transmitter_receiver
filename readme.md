Laser transmitter and receiver, version 2.0

!!! Please consider, that using the laser beam is dangerus and wearing protective tools is required !!!


This schematics and PCB was designed and created by me and I am ok with using this resources for your own educational purposes.
If you decide to build it and use it in public, you can use my credentials as a resource, of course,)

DATA:

There are project folders created by PCB tool Kicad 4.0.4, but I dont think it will work once you download it and open in Kicad 
(because Kicad has terrible library management). Therefore I created another folder with pdf document with schematics, 
pcb boards and I also included the .svg file in case you want to manually tune the boards a bit using for example inscape.
Enjoy
